# Run the code below to set up the data

library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
y2015 <- filter(babynames, year==2015)
y2015

# Create a histogram of the number of babies with a name in 2015
# Pick an appropriate number of bins (no right answer)
# Log the x axis
# Facet the graph by sex
# Set the axis labels and title appropriately

# Note: there are a lot of names; it could take a second to plot





# Bonus: Change the facet labels to Female and Male
